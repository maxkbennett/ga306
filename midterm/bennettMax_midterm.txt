1 A function.2 A default argument (you assign value to the argument when you define the function) 3 Both *args and **wkargs are both containers for multiple arguments without a definite number for the number of arguments. They are different in that *args are non-keyworded meaning they are only accessed positionaly, while **kwargs are keyworded, and can be assessed by keyword.  4 First is the first number in the range (inclusive), the second is the number AFTER the last number in the range, and the last argument is the “step” which tells the function which numbers to skip (this can also be negative, reading the range backwards)5 Conditional statements (“if” statements)6 For and conditional statements.
